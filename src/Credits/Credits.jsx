          <p>
            I made this website as a birthday gift to my wonderful mum, but it also happens to coincide 
            with the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of ABBA's iconic Eurovision win in 1974. 
            <br></br>
            Browse through the bandâ€™s 9 studio albums, whose songs are represented as a â€˜musical constellationâ€™, 
            and visualised though a data art interpretation of musical features and Spotify metrics (energy, danceability, valence, loudness, tempo). 
            The celestial theme reflects on Abbaâ€™s journey and the â€˜voyageâ€™ theme of their latest album release in 2021. 
            Pro tip: browse through the songs alongside someone and see how much you agree with the values of the 
            Spotify metrics. I find that danceability tends to be particularly contentions.
